We're all trapped in a race to the bottom.
A downward-spiral of incentives that erodes human values until we're nothing but consumers.
To survive in these systems is to destroy the planet, fray our minds, and empty our communities.
No one is in control, and still the machine marches on.

We built that machine out of a 20th-century invention: the corporation.
Companies exist to lower the costs of coordination, but artificial intelligence, global networks, and programmable money are driving those costs to zero.

Now strangers from across the globe can share value directly and coordinate through software instead of hierarchy. This makes space for a new kind of organization: one that turns shared belief into impact, and impact into upside for everyone who contributes.

Our vision is a network of mission-driven organizations where millions of people earn a living advancing goals they deeply care about.
Something that feels more like a tribe and less like a 9 to 5.
Sustainable systems of belief that protect human values instead of sacrificing them.
Cultures that reward honesty, stewardship, and courage as strongly as today's markets reward profit at any cost.

For the first time in human history, we can turn subcultures into livelihoods and values into incentives.
We can rewrite the reward function of civilization.

We commit to using the tools of the intelligence age to design and deploy these new organizations responsibly, so anyone, anywhere can earn a living building for the values they believe in, and benefit all of humanity in the process.`;

export const beliefs = `## Our Mission

**Our mission is to increase community-driven impact in the world.**

Today's institutions weren't designed for the intelligence age.
The firm was a workaround for expensive coordination, where hierarchy replaced markets because finding and trusting strangers was slow and costly.
That constraint is gone.

The internet gave us global affinity.
Blockchains gave us shared ownership.
AI gave us abundant judgment.
We now have everything we need to replace the firm with the network.

Our vision is a world where millions of people earn a living advancing missions they care about.
Our hope is that we can **rewrite civilization’s reward function away from maximizing profit and more explicitly toward human values.**

## Our beliefs

**Networks, not firms.**
The best work happens in communities of shared belief, not corporate org charts.
We build infrastructure for networks to hold assets, make decisions, and reward contributors.

**Meaning, not just profit.**
People want to give their full effort to something that matters.
The next great organizations won't sell products; they'll co-create culture.
We give these communities economic rails.

**Bottom-up allocation.**
Markets work because they aggregate millions of small judgments into accurate prices.
Grants fail because committees can't scale.
We build market-like primitives that route capital to where organic attention and value already flow.

**Permissionless by default.**
Anyone can contribute. Anyone can earn. Anyone can build.
No gatekeepers deciding who gets to participate in the upside.

**Transparent rules, not opaque bureaucracy.**
Smart contracts let us encode allocation logic that everyone can inspect and no one can unilaterally override.

**Owned by builders, not just funders.**
We believe the best global movements will be owned by their builders as much as they're owned by the people contributing capital.
You should be able to earn a vote for your efforts and steer the energy of the movement you're contributing to.

## The bet

If we can allocate capital as accurately as markets do, but for work that doesn't have a price tag, fundraising becomes easy and millions of people can earn a living advancing missions they actually believe in.

We're building the coordination engine that enables this future.`;

export const billOfRights = `# The Cobuild Bill of Rights

A moral bill of rights for a world where thousands of communities can coordinate materially.

## I. The Right to Permissionless Opportunity

Anyone, anywhere can contribute, earn, and build without needing permission.

## II. The Right to Earn Ownership

Work should earn you a stake. Contributors deserve ownership in the networks they help build, not just payment, but voice.

## III. The Right to Verifiability

Important rules and outcomes must be checkable from public data.

## IV. The Right to Exit, Fork, and Rebuild

If governance, culture, or leadership fails, people can leave without begging and fork what they helped create.

## V. The Right to Voluntary Association

Your community should be chosen, not inherited. People deserve to opt into the cultures they belong to and opt out when they no longer fit.

## VI. The Right to Credible Commitments

Core invariants cannot be changed unilaterally, silently, or mid-game after people have committed time, work, and identity.

## VII. The Right to Distributed Power

No single constituency (founders, whales, operators, regulators, or mobs) should unilaterally steer outcomes.

## VIII. The Right to Informed Cultural Participation

Communities can build strong cultures, but members deserve clarity about what the culture asks of them and protection from manipulation disguised as belonging.

## IX. The Right to Trust-Minimized Coordination

No indispensable intermediaries for critical actions. Anyone can participate through alternative clients and compatible surfaces, without permission.

## X. The Right to Privacy and Pseudonymity

People can contribute, coordinate, and earn without being forced to reveal their identity, financial history, or social graph. Privacy is a civil liberty; pseudonymity is a safety tool.

## XI. The Right to Due Process and Equal Protection

No one should lose access, reputation, funds, or standing through arbitrary or opaque decisions. Rules must apply consistently, with notice, evidence, and a path to appeal.

## XII. The Right to Subsidiarity and Local Autonomy

Decisions should be made at the smallest scope that can competently make them. Global rails should not become the arena for every cultural or political dispute.

## XIII. The Right to Self-Custody and Secure Property

People must be able to hold and move what they earn (funds, credentials, reputation) without relying on a custodian or a privileged administrator. A right you can't exercise under failure conditions isn't a right.

## XIV. Substrate, Not Sovereign

This network is a coordination substrate, not a moral authority. It should help communities build, not become the thing that tells everyone what to be.

## XV. Human Dignity and Non-Coercion

Subcultures get sovereignty, but not a license for coercion, dehumanization, or violence.
 censorship?

## XVI. Net-Positive to Humanity

A network that only benefits its members has failed. The best subcultures create value that spills over: open culture, shared knowledge, public goods.

export const charter = `## 1. What winning means

### Why this goal exists

This goal funds Cobuild's near-term execution and proves the "network fundraising → allocation flywheel" works in production.

### Primary success condition

**Cumulative net inflows to the sale treasury ≥ $1,000,000 USDC by June 30, 2026** (or other declared base asset).

Treasury balance is a steering metric and runway indicator, not the success metric—spending during the raise (marketing, audits, contractors) doesn't reset progress.

### What counts toward the $1M

**Counts:**
- Net inflows to the **designated sale treasury** from primary issuance (and any explicitly approved sale rails).

**Does NOT count** unless explicitly declared:
- AMM secondary buys
- Wash/looped volume
- Team wallets recycling funds
- "Soft commitments," OTC IOUs, or verbal pledges

### Secondary health indicators

*Used to steer, not to claim success*

- Pace to target (weekly net inflow vs required runway)
- Mint flow health (drop-offs in the mint flow)
- Reach health (unique wallets; repeat participation)
- Contributor throughput (verified contributions/week)

---

## 2. Non-negotiables for this goal

### Fundraising integrity that protects the raise

Everything public-facing (posts, landing copy, FAQs, partner blurbs, spaces) must be framed so we don't create legal/reputation blowback or lose credibility mid-raise.

- **No ROI framing:** no "returns," "profit," "guaranteed upside," price predictions, or "early = cheap = win" language.
- **No "floor = protection" framing:** we can describe mechanics, but never imply safety, guarantees, or "you can always get your money back."
- **No fake urgency:** if we say "price changes on X date," it must be true per stage schedule.
- **Claims must be provable:** anything we assert about mechanics, custody, audits, allocations, or traction must be linkable/verifiable (or we don't say it).

**If violated:** we pause outbound promotion, publish a correction, and tighten the comms template before resuming.

---

## 3. Operating cadence

A goal is a closed-loop control system: **sense** reality, **decide** what to do, **act** on it. Repeat.

### Sense (what's actually happening)

- Treasury balance and pace to target
- Mint funnel: where are people dropping off?
- Reach: what's driving attention? What isn't?
- Who's doing real work? What's blocked?

### Decide (what to do next)

- Identify the single biggest bottleneck (credibility, reach, or activation)
- Open/close briefs based on what's actually moving the needle
- Allocate budget only to work tied to the current bottleneck

### Act (ship, distribute, transact)

- Execute on the current briefs
- Publish updates, artifacts, and progress
- Pay contributors for verified work

---

## 4. Failure modes we defend against

- **"Hype without activation"** → Funnel clarity + UX + evidence
- **"Spam farming rewards"** → Stake + challenges + conservative budgets
- **"Opaque allocation drama"** → Public record + non-retroactive rules
- **"Treasury mis-spend"** → Multisig + caps + accountability
- **"Runaway complexity"** → Few briefs, strict linkage

---

## 6. Strategy: how we expect to reach $1M

*This is our starting hypothesis, not a fixed plan. Expect it to evolve as we learn what actually works.*

### The core levers

1. **Credibility:** clear mechanics, risk disclosure, credible commitments, simple UX
2. **Reach:** consistent narrative beats + partner amplification
3. **Activation:** remove friction at every step of minting

### Operating priorities (always pick one bottleneck)

At any moment, we pick the single biggest bottleneck:
- Credibility bottleneck (confusion, fear, legitimacy gaps)
- Reach bottleneck (not enough qualified attention)
- Activation bottleneck (too hard to mint; too many errors)

All new briefs must tie to the current bottleneck unless explicitly escalated.

---

## 7. Budget policy

### Disallowed by default

- "Pay for hype" spend with no measurable attribution
- Bots, engagement farms, or artificial amplification
- Anything that implies financial promotion or guarantee language
- Paid endorsements without clear disclosure
- Airdrops or giveaways designed to inflate metrics
- Large upfront payments (prefer milestone-based)
- Speculative trading or yield farming with treasury funds
- Spending that can't be explained publicly

---

## 8. Completion and shutdown

### On success (exceeds $1M)

- Publish final recap: what worked, what didn't, where money went
- Document reusable briefs and playbooks
- Pause new briefs unless explicitly extended

### If timebox ends without success

- Publish post-mortem focused on bottlenecks (not vibes)
- Recommend next goal as a concrete bottleneck-killer`;
